### Cloudflare Workers

This app uses OpenNext for Cloudflare and Prisma's PostgreSQL driver adapter. Configure these runtime secrets in the Cloudflare dashboard before deploying:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH_SECRET` or `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

Then build and deploy:

```bash
npm run build:cf
npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy -- --keep-vars
```

### Vercel / Node

```bash
npm run build:app
```

The app uses `output: "standalone"` for Node deployments. Set environment variables in your deployment platform.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t proppreserve .
docker run -p 3000:3000 proppreserve
```
